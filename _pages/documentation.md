# Geometer's Skecthpad Software Documentation
This Geometerâ€™s Sketchpad handout is for students to read and to reference as needed when using the software in class. This handout does not include instructions for how to use the software; it is an explanation of the software, its purpose, how it will be used, and an introduction to the user interface and available options.
