# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

This lesson is part of the <a href="https://lisasteaching.github.io/lisasteaching.github.io/planning/" target="_blank"><i>Lay a Foundation</i></a> curriculum proposal.

Students learn the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and how to identify the prime factorization of a number. Students reason and solve problems related to prime factorization for practice and thought development.

# Identifying Factors, Primes, and Composites

This lesson is part of the <a href="https://lisasteaching.github.io/lisasteaching.github.io/planning/" target="_blank"><i>Lay a Foundation</i></a> curriculum proposal.

Students review what it means for a number to be a factor of another, review the difference between prime and composite numbers, review divisibility rules and create a quick reference, and apply this knowledge to logic puzzles to develop deductive reasoning skills.

# Calculus Concept Prep
This lesson is part of the <a href="https://lisasteaching.github.io/lisasteaching.github.io/planning/" target="_blank"><i>Lay a Foundation</i></a> curriculum proposal.

Students explore the concept of change and how change is represented in words, tables, and graphs. Students discover what size square to cut from the corners of a piece of paper to maximize the volume of the resulting box (when sides are folded up). Students create a graph of all of the student “boxes” with respect to the size of the cut square and the volume and interpret what the graph means. Students learn that Calculus can be used to find a more precise answer more quickly. Students practice interpreting other graphs in terms of the change represented.
