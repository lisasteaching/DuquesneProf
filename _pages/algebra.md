### Get Creative with Polynomials
  
In this project students use their imaginations to create a building or outside space (e.g., park, zoo habitat, space station, museum, sports complex). There are four parts to this project: writing, drawing, math, and display. Students describe their construction through writing and drawing. They find the area of their construction in terms of an unknown value. All dimensions used to find the total area, whether length, width, or radius, must be represented by linear binomials. They display their work neatly and creatively on a poster board.

Through writing students describe how the sides of their constructions relate to one another or to another object to explain how they derived their linear binomial. Students also describe the purpose of the construction, how people will use it, and the benefits of the design (why did they choose a rectangular or circular layout?). The drawing shows the floor plan or plan of the grounds to show the arrangement of rooms or spaces. Students also label their drawings with the measurements and the names of the rooms or spaces.

You can see that students were very creative with this project. Some even created objects that were not buildings or outdoor spaces, as in the lollipop and picture frame projects shown below. More projects with close up pictures of the text and drawings can be viewed by downloading the slideshow provided below the images.

### Do Everything Twice

The anticipatory set in this lesson engages students in a story that portrays a real-life scenario with a fictional twist. The story leads logically into the lesson where students discover the addition and subtraction properties of equality and develop a procedure for solving equations with them.
