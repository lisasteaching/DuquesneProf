### Get Creative with Polynomials
  
In this project students use their imaginations to create a building or outside space (e.g., park, zoo habitat, space station, museum, sports complex). There are four parts to this project: writing, drawing, math, and display. Students describe their construction through writing and drawing. They find the area of their construction in terms of an unknown value. All dimensions used to find the total area, whether length, width, or radius, must be represented by linear binomials. They display their work neatly and creatively on a poster board.

Through writing students describe how the sides of their constructions relate to one another or to another object to explain how they derived their linear binomial. Students also describe the purpose of the construction, how people will use it, and the benefits of the design (why did they choose a rectangular or circular layout?). The drawing shows the floor plan or plan of the grounds to show the arrangement of rooms or spaces. Students also label their drawings with the measurements and the names of the rooms or spaces.

You can see that students were very creative with this project. Some even created objects that were not buildings or outdoor spaces, as in the lollipop and picture frame projects shown below. More projects with close up pictures of the text and drawings can be viewed by downloading the slideshow provided below the images.

### Do Everything Twice

The anticipatory set in this lesson engages students in a story that portrays a real-life scenario with a fictional twist. The story leads logically into the lesson where students discover the addition and subtraction properties of equality and develop a procedure for solving equations with them.

### Pythagorean Theorm Life Application Webquest

The Life Application webquest for the Pythagorean Theorem has three phases:</p>

* Phase 1: Consider a real-life scenario. Break down the problem by drawing a diagram to show known and unknown information and by researching possibilities to satisfy the criterion.
* Phase 2: Create a table to organize your information. Synthesize and evaluate all possible solutions against given criterion and propose a solution.
* Phase 3: Create your own problem that requires the Pythagorean Theorem. Include at least one criterion that requires gathering information to compare and contrast two or more options. Solve your problem.

### Pythagorean Theorm History and Proof Webquest

The History and Proof webquest for the Pythagorean Theorem has three phases:</p>

* Phase 1: Read about Pythagoras, tell a little bit about his life, and paraphrase how he discovered the proof.
* Phase 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem given values to plug into the formula.
* Phase 3: Evaluate three proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem and select one to paraphrase and reconstruct.

### Scientific Notation Webquest

This webquest is a fun way for students to recall scientific notation and its purpose. After a lesson to help students recall how to convert numbers to and from scientific notation, students logged on to their school accounts and found two facts each containing a number that was either less than 0.001 or greater than 1000. Students then wrote the number in scientific or standard notation or both if the original number was in neither form.

#### Reflection
Some students were really involved in this activity and obviously had fun finding their facts. They found some really interesting ones such as the estimated number of blades of grass on the Earth, the number of gallons of water on the Earth, the radius of an electron, the number of individual M&Ms made per day, the number of people employed by McDonald's, etc. My students were very competitive and started competing for the largest and smallest numbers.
