# Real World Geometry

In this activity, students have a chance to consider some real-world objects and how their geometric form makes them useful or possible. To get started, students select three geometric figures to study. These can be 2-D, 3-D, or a combination of both.

# Introduction to Coordinate Geometry

In this lesson, students read about the coordinate plane to learn new vocabulary and to review how to graph points. Students preview the unit to see how geometric figures are represented on a coordinate plane. Students practice terminology by naming the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and quadrant of several points. In groups, students explore how to determine a pointâ€™s quadrant without graphing the point. Finally, students practice graphing by taking turns graphing points on the board.

# Coordinate Systems Life Connection

In this lesson, students read about coordinate systems to reinforce the vocabulary they will need to know for the unit. Students read about a real-life application of coordinate systems and compare and contrast the geographic system with the one we will use in class.

# Arcs and Chords

Students are assigned one of four circle and chord constructions based on a theorem. Each student constructs the circle and chords following given specifications. Students measure angles or line segments and interpret and discuss the results with other students assigned the same construction/theorem. In a jigsaw activity, each student reports and demonstrates their assigned theorem to students who were assigned a different theorem. As a class, students prove the theorems and then use the theorems to analyze and solve a real-life problem.
