# Real World Geometry

In this activity, you will have a chance to consider some real-world objects and how their geometric form makes them useful or possible. To get started, select three geometric figures to study. These can be 2-D, 3-D, or a combination of both.

# Introduction to Coordinate Geometry

In this lesson, students will read about the coordinate plane to learn new vocabulary and to review how to graph points. Students will preview the unit to see how geometric figures are represented on a coordinate plane. Students will practice terminology by naming the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and quadrant of several points. In groups, students will explore how to determine a pointâ€™s quadrant without graphing the point. Finally, students will practice graphing by taking turns graphing points on the board.

# Coordinate Systems Life Connection

In this lesson, students will read about coordinate systems to reinforce the vocabulary they will need to know for the unit. Students will read about a real-life application of coordinate systems and compare and contrast the geographic system with the one we will use in class.
