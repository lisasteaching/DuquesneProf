### Create a Sampling Distribution

Each student will obtain and calculate the mean for eight different simple random samples of size 4 from a population of exam grades. The class will construct a histogram of sample means to illustrate a sampling distribution. The teacher will demonstrate a sampling distribution from the same population using sample size n=2. Students will consider the sampling distributions of sample means and the population distribution in light of the purpose of statistics, i.e., to make inferences about the population from sample data.

#### Note about the Central Limit Theorem

It is not practical to use this lesson to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem because students would have to calculate the means of multiple samples with n=25 or more. The more difficult concept here is the sampling distribution itself. This activity lays a strong foundation for students to understand the Central Limit Theorem by illustrating what a sampling distribution is. I then use computer simulations to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem in the next lesson.

### M&Ms Introduce Students to Statistics

This two-day introductory lesson engages students in the data analysis process and develops their statistical thinking with a data gathering activity, a pre-reading anticipatory set of questions, a reading assignment, and a post-reading lecture with guided notes. Students in my college business statistics course gathered data by weighing packages of M&amp;Ms and counted the number of each color. Students entered the data into an online survey and analyzed the results in a spreadsheet. The applications of this student-collected data included discussions and activities about cleaning data, calculating numerical summaries, creating graphs, calculating probabilities, and determining independence.

When I first did this activity, I used only plain M&amp;Ms. If you have enough students (to gather a large enough sample for analysis), I recommend using both plain and peanut M&amp;Ms. I had my students gather data on peanut M&amp;Ms during another class period but the novelty had worn off by then. Gathering data on both types of M&amp;Ms allows you to explore more concepts than with just one type. 

#### Concepts to Explore with the M&amp;M Data

* Cleaning data - It is very likely that someone is going to enter bad data (typos, misunderstanding instructions, or just being funny) and this is a good opportunity to discuss whether records with questionable data should be ignored, fixed, or deleted).

* Numerical Summaries - Collecting weights and color counts allows students to create both categorical and continuous summaries (proportions and means).

* Graphs - I used this dataset to demonstrate creating bar and pie charts and histograms in Excel. Students compared the distribution of weight and colors for plain and peanut M&amp;Ms.

* Probability - I used this dataset to illustrate relative frequency, probability, and independence. What is the proportion of red M&amp;Ms? That <em>depends</em> on what type of M&amp;M you are talking about.
