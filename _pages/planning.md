# Lay a Foundation Curriculum Proposal

This nine-week curriculum is designed to “lay a foundation” for higher level mathematical thinking while also maintaining a strong focus on content. Through this curriculum, middle school pre-algebra students will have numerous developmentally-appropriate opportunities to practice problem solving techniques, engage in reasoning and proof, develop communication skills, discover connections among mathematical topics, and explore various representations of concepts and data (NCTM, 2010). This proposal includes three sample lessons, one activity with a rubric, and an assessment.
