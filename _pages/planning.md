# Lay a Foundation Curriculum Proposal

This nine-week curriculum is designed to “lay a foundation” for higher level mathematical thinking while also maintaining a strong focus on content. Through this curriculum, middle school pre-algebra students will have numerous developmentally-appropriate opportunities to practice problem solving techniques, engage in reasoning and proof, develop communication skills, discover connections among mathematical topics, and explore various representations of concepts and data (NCTM, 2010). This proposal includes three sample lessons, one activity with a rubric, and an assessment.

# Geometry Unit Plan

This high school geometry unit includes content and skills that are directly related to the PSSA exam and to real life. This unit also prepares students for advanced math such as Algebra II and Pre-calculus. This plan includes two sample lessons.

# Classroom Management Plan

Classroom management is a mechanism that powers the learning process. The primary goal of classroom management is to provide a safe, comfortable, and enriching environment where many students with different personalities and diverse abilities and skills can learn. Only within this environment can I meet the individual needs of my students and engage each one in a successful quest for greater knowledge and skills.

# Incentive Plan for Academic Performance

The purpose of my academic incentive program is to encourage students to work hard and to teach them that hard work leads to success. The amount of effort students put into their work will depend on the expectations I set for them and on what students think about meeting those expectations. My incentive program promotes effort in learning by breaking down my expectations into smaller, incremental goals. For example, if my expectation is for my students to pass the unit test, I reward them on a daily basis for completing related homework assignments, taking notes, and participating in class. As students meet my incremental expectations, they increase their chances of meeting my final expectation of passing the unit test. When they pass the test, students will see the connection between their success and the effort they exerted to prepare for it.
