            <h3>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</h3>
            <p>This lesson is part of the <a href="planning.php">"Lay a Foundation" curriculum proposal</a>.</p> 
            <p>Students learn the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and how to 
                identify the prime factorization of a number. Students reason and 
                solve problems related to prime factorization for practice and thought 
                development.</p>

            <H3>Identifying Factors, Primes, and Composites</H3>
            <p>This lesson is part of the <a href="planning.php">"Lay a Foundation" curriculum proposal</a>.</p>
            <p>Students review what it means for a number to be a factor of another, 
                review the difference between prime and composite numbers, 
                review divisibility rules and create a quick reference, and 
                apply this knowledge to logic puzzles to develop deductive 
                reasoning skills.</p>

            <H3>Deductive Puzzling Activity</H3>
            <p>This activity is part of the <a href="planning.php">"Lay a Foundation" curriculum proposal</a>.</p>
            <p>Students practice deductive reasoning and mathematical language skills 
                as they solve Shikaku puzzles.</p>

            <H3>Calculus Concept Prep</H3>
            <p>This lesson is part of the <a href="planning.php">"Lay a Foundation" curriculum proposal</a>.</p>
            <p>Students explore the concept of change and how change is represented 
                in words, tables, and graphs. Students discover what size square to 
                cut from the corners of a piece of paper to maximize the volume of the 
                resulting box (when sides are folded up). Students create a graph of all 
                of the student “boxes” with respect to the size of the cut square and 
                the volume and interpret what the graph means. Students learn that 
                Calculus can be used to find a more precise answer more quickly. 
                Students practice interpreting other graphs in terms of the change 
                represented.</p>
