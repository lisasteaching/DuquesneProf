The book for this course was <i>Crossing the River with Dogs: Problem Solving for College Students</i>, 2nd Edition, by Johnson, Herr, Kysh. All homework, in-class activities, and assessment problems were taken from the text. Throughout the semester, in collaboration with others and on their own, students solved a variety of problems using techniques and strategies from statistics and probability, number theory, general mathematical laws, logic, Venn diagrams, and graph theory. The file below is an example of the kinds of problems in which students engaged and an example of student solutions.
